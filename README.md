# SwiftUX

An experimental generic controller layer in Swift, based on the old `NSController` family, SwiftUI practices and many,
many years of experience building apps.

The API is not stable yet and is being co-developed with a number of personal apps to ensure it fulfills its mission in
a useful way. As such, I cannot recommend for anyone else to use it as it currently stands. I will happily take
feedback anyway. 

Currently in use in https://github.com/Gabardone/LunchQuest.git as a first test case.
